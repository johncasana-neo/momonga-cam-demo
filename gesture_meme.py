"""
Webcam gesture -> meme detector (desktop version).

Opens two windows, side by side like the OBS/streamer setups:
  - "Camera": your webcam feed with hand landmarks drawn on top
  - "Meme": the cat meme matching whatever gesture you're making

Gestures (trimmed to 5 - momonga edition):
  default (no hand, neutral face)               -> memes/momonga_default.jpg
  huh cat (mouth open AND eyes wide, no hands)   -> memes/momonga_huhcat.jpg
  side eye (head turned to the side)             -> memes/momonga_side.jpg
  side eye down (head tilted DOWN, not turned)   -> memes/momonga_down.jpg
  fist / punch                                   -> memes/momonga_fist.jpg

Facial expressions (huh cat above) use MediaPipe's face blendshapes -
pre-computed expression scores (0-1) that come from the same face model,
rather than hand-rolled landmark geometry.

The Camera window shows a live debug readout (head yaw/pitch vs. their
trigger thresholds) in the top-left corner so side-eye can be tuned by eye -
see SIDE_EYE_YAW_DEG below. Spin/dance/optical-flow code below is unused
dead weight now that those gestures are gone - left in in case you want them
back, safe to delete otherwise.

# discrimination - averaging magnitude across the whole frame already dilutes
# out small localized motions (a hand gesture only fills a fraction of the
# frame, so the frame-wide average stays low regardless of coherence).
#
# What actually separates a real spin from a quick lean/reach turned out to
# be less about "how high does it peak" (both can peak similarly for an
# instant) and more about *how much of a multi-second window stays elevated*.
# A real spin is naturally bursty - you slow down, reposition, speed back
# up - so requiring one perfectly unbroken stretch above threshold was too
# strict and rejected real spins. Instead: over a trailing ~2.2s window,
# what fraction of frames had magnitude above a modest threshold? A real
# spin (even a "weak"/bursty one) kept that fraction above ~0.9; a one-off
